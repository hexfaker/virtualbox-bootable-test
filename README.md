# VirtualBox bootable drive test

This script is intended for testing bootability of disk drives with Oracle VirtualBox on Linux

Usage: **vbox-bootable-test** */path/to/disk*

NOTE: Script requires full access to specified disk, so usually you will run it from root.

Example: sudo vbox-bootable-test /dev/sdb

PS: This script is yet under development. It does what it says it does, but looks and behaves not so pretty as it should
